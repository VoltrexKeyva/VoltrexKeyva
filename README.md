Hey, I am Mohammed Keyvanzadeh, known online as Voltrex (or VoltrexKeyva). I've been a software engineer for many years and have been obsessed with open-source for a long time, developing libraries, designing programming languages, making compilers and optimizers, tinkering with video game development, and many more. I often contribute to many projects (mainly big ones) and maintain multiple of them.

You may know me from my work in the:

- [Node.js organization](https://github.com/nodejs) and it's following projects:
  - [Node.js JavaScript runtime environment](https://nodejs.org/)
  - [Node.js Core Utilities](https://nodejs.github.io/node-core-utils)
- [V8 JavaScript engine](https://v8.dev/)
- [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/)
- [LLVM Project](https://llvm.org/)
- [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](https://ietf.org/)
- [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://w3.org/)

I mostly work on programming language design and compilers, as well as web and internet standards, it's always amazing to see how far they go and the impact they have.
